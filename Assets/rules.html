    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>You will be given 6 different tasks you have to complete over the duration of the game</p>
    <p>If someone completes one of your tasks, click on the task and then click on the player that completed the task</p>
    <p>Some tasks are global tasks that everyone will be given, which will be shown by the task having 'Global: ' before it</p>
    <p>Be careful when trying to complete a task, as the more times you fail to complete it, the harder it will get to successfully complete it</p>
